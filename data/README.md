# Water-Borne Disease Prediction 🚰🦠

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the risk of **water-borne diseases** based on water quality, weather, and health data.  
It also includes an **interactive map** (Folium) to visualize high-risk areas for outbreaks.  

Built as part of **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025**.
